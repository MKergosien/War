# War
War was given to us as a project in class. It was frustrating and I found it very dificult in many areas. This app is still
not functional. I struggled from the begenning with how to seperate the work for 2 players and to get those 2 players to 
play against each other. I also had a hard time comprehending how to assign values to the cards. There is also still no "winner"
functionality. I ended up duplicating code and made the work much harder than it needed to be. I hope one day soon to come
back to this project and finish it.
